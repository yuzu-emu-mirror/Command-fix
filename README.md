There's your token! Now its time to invite your bot to your server. Don't worry about your bot being started for this next step. Change the `client_id` in the URL to your Client ID under App Details, then go to this url ```https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0```
