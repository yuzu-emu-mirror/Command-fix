      "states": {"reply": "Citra has two kinds of saves available to users, in-game saves and save states.\n\nIn-game saves are the ones you know from the 3DS. These can be shared between devices and are recommended for general use, as they do not corrupt as easily.\nSave states, on the other hand, save Citra's entire emulation state. This includes Citra's configuration, a game's RNG seed, as well as any faults in the emulation at the time of saving. This makes them very useful as a tool for practicing in-game tricks, or for usage in shiny hunting and other RNG related trigger events. However they're not suitable as replacements for in-game save files as the faults in the emulation state would keep building up until the emulation state is too unstable to load properly. They're also ***non-transferable*** because they are made with one setup and only one."},
